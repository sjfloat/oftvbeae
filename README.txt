OCaml from the Very Beginning
=============================

The directories for Chapters 2 to 15 contain two files each, one with the
examples from the text of the chapter, and one with the answers to the
exercises. Where answers depend on functions written earlier, they are included
in the file too.

Chapter 16 has its own README file.
